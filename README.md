# akka-http-swagger

Akka-Http-Swagger brings [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core) support for [Akka](http://akka.io) Apis. The included ```SwaggerHttpService``` route will inspect Scala types with Swagger annotations and build a swagger compliant endpoint for a [swagger compliant ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui).

The swagger spec [swagger spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) is helpful for understanding the swagger api and resource declaration semantics behind swagger-core annotations.
